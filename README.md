# dictionary
It is always tedious work to find the meaning of the word in the dictionary, 
But I have created dictionary which can find you the meaning of the word just in few seconds.You can build an interactive dictionary using python language by just using the basic concepts like JSON, functions, and conditional statement. 
Also, we can add the function to check the close matches of the word that the user's input is made of an error in typing or spelling. You will need a JSON file for the data which will contain the word and its meaning and then upload that file to find the correct meaning of the word user searched.
